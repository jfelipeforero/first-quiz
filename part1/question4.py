#
# Instructions:
# Question 4 and Question 5 are about writing SQL. THey use the database that is 
# created in the file `pets_db.py`. 
# These questions use a database called SQLite. You do not need to install anything.
# In the file `pets_db.py` three tables are created. Data is then added to each 
# of the tables. The questions below are about how the data in each of the tables
# is related.

# Part 4.A:
# Write SQL to select the pets that are owned by nobody.
# The output should be a list of tuples in the format: (<pet name>, <species>, <age>)

sql_pets_owned_by_nobody = """
SELECT a.name, a.species, a.age FROM animals AS a WHERE a.animal_id NOT IN (SELECT pet_id FROM people_animals);
"""

# Part 4.B:
# Write SQL to select how the number of pets are older than their owners. 
# The output should be an integer.

sql_pets_older_than_owner = """
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM animals AS a INNER JOIN 
(SELECT pa.pet_id, p.age FROM people AS p INNER JOIN people_animals as pa ON p.person_id = pa.owner_id) AS o
on a.animal_id = o.pet_id WHERE a.age > o.age;
"""

# Part 4.C: BONUS CHALLENGE! 
# Write SQL to select the pets that are owned by Bessie and nobody else.
# The output should be a list of tuples in the format: (<person name>, <pet name>, <species>)
sql_only_owned_by_bessie = """ 
SELECT o.name as ow_name, a.name AS an_name, a.species FROM animals AS a INNER JOIN 
(SELECT pa.pet_id, p.name FROM people AS p INNER JOIN people_animals as pa ON p.person_id = pa.owner_id) AS o
on a.animal_id = o.pet_id GROUP by a.name HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT o.name) = 1 AND o.name = "bessie";
